# Hello? Hello!
Hi, I’m @hawkBaby, I’m interested in tinkering. As I don't have access to a garden shed and a bunch of smoke alarms, I use this place instead. 
I’m currently learning C# for work, Rust for funsies and new and creative ways to stack beer cans on my desk. I figure now that ML is here I should spend some time learning the internal mechanics rather than just playing with it. 

I can be contacted via the usual channels or by simply shouting quite loudly into the wind or by repeating my name infront a mirror five times. Alternatively just ping me here.

All projects/opinions expressed here should be considered artistic works of falsehood or fiction, will not be associated with any of my professional endeavors.
